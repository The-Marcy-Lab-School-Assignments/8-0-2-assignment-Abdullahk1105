# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The danger of making API requests with API key from the frontend is that you can accidentally leak your API key, and the client can see that key on theit side, If the client has and bad intent the client can use it to do illegal activities under your name. Making a API request from the server avoids this because the user cannot see the backend, the backend is only avaliable to the engineer, so the API key will be safe.
